         <p style="margin-left: 100px; font-size: large;">What started in 2013, with a simple goal of increasing awareness about the skate culture in Mumbai,<br> has now evolved into a deep rooted 
            passion towards accelerating the growth of our community.<br><br>
            Just like the community we represent, we are unorthodox in our methods, eccentric in our style, and<br> determined in our approach. We strive to keep our 
            work unique and smart, with room for a little magic.</p>
